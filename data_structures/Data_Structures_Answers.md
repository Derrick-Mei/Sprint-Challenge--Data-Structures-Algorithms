Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    1. O(n) - as the size grows, the complexity grows at a constant rate

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    1. O(1) - as the size grows, the space required does not grow

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    1. O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    1. O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
